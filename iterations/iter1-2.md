Angela    Fixed the CSS on the homepage, set up codeclimate and travis CI
          Ensured rspec and cucumber tests were working after iteration

Jacen     Built and applied the ui-redesign for the homepage, "My Dogs"
          Page, and "Add a dog" page

Jessica   Wrote tests that verified that links between pages would work, 
          and also combined the two facebook authentication processes
          (log in and sign up)

Jennifer  Wrote tests that verified seeing the 'My Dog' page and being
          able to view their profiles

Judy      Tested for intuitive navigation between the pages

a couple notes:

users_controller	=>	update_attributes call in edit method not working properly
dogs_controller		=>	@dogs.photo.destroy call in destroy method not working properly
				because of the next issue
aws-gem			=>	I updated the aws-gem to version 2 where they have different syntax/way of stubbing
				so in rails_helper.rb and dog_steps.rb I'm trying to do the stubbing properly 
				(commented out is what was there before) This thing is causing the majority of the issues I think

Also 1 db failue
and other stuff
im sleepy
